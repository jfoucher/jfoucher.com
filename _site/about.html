<p>This is the about page of Jonathan Foucher, my blog and notebook about web development.</p>

<p>I mostly do php, but I love learning new. At the moment, I am simultaneously writing an iOs app, an Android app, a Java enterprise web application, moving my blog from <a href="http://jfoucher.com/wordpress/" title="My Wordpress plugins and themes">Wordpress</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/">Jekyll</a>, and a few PHP webapps here and there.</p>
