This is the about page of Jonathan Foucher, my blog and notebook about web development.

I mostly do php, but I love learning new. At the moment, I am simultaneously writing an iOs app, an Android app, a Java enterprise web application, moving my blog from [Wordpress](http://jfoucher.com/wordpress/ "My Wordpress plugins and themes") to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/), and a few PHP webapps here and there.
