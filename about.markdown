---



Founder of [Six Pixels](http://6px.eu), a web design and development shop operating out of spain

I have a degree in Yacht Design from Southampton Solent University. I am first and foremost a [freelance web developper, based in France](http://jfoucher.fr) and working for international companies and public entities.

Some of my clients include global companies like Bosch and Coca Cola, and spanish ones such as Fundaci√≥n Mapfre, Ayuntamiento de Alcobendas and Museo Thyssen.

I love working with PHP and Javascript to develop an engaging user experience. I also really enjoy learning new skills. For example, at the moment, I am simultaneously writing an iOs app, an Android app, a Java enterprise web application, moving my blog from [Wordpress](http://jfoucher.com/wordpress/ "My Wordpress plugins and themes") to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/), developping desktop apps with [appcelerator Titanium](http://appcelerator.com) and working on a few PHP webapps.

###About this blog
