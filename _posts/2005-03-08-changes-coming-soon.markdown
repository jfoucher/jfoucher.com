Since the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/">release of Wordpress 1.5</a>, I've been wondering what to do with this blog. 

I looked at upgrading, but that would mean a few days of work to have the blog the way I like it again. I hacked WP 1.2 so much that it would be very difficult to just upgrade and expect everything to go smoothly. Also I asked to myself: do I really need a blogging tool to do coffee as well as allow me to publish stuff easily. I guess I mean that Wordpress now has many more features than I have use for, and I don't really see the point of it.

So there you have it, I decided to design a blogging software from scratch. Yes, it takes some work, but maybe not much more as what I put in to hack wordpress. It's a great learning exercise anyway...
