<div class="image-with-caption aligncenter" style="width:300px"><div class="caption">CleanFolio</div><a href="http://jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/06/screenshot.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-130" title="CleanFolio" src="http://jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/06/screenshot-300x187.png" alt="CleanFolio" width="300" height="187" /></a></div>

I've been working on my profesionnal portfolio these days, and I'm thinking about releasing the theme. It's a very clean and white design, with a jQuery carousel to present my past work. You can see a demo on <a href="http://jfoucher.fr">Jonathan Foucher's portfolio</a>. So, should I release it? Do you like it?
