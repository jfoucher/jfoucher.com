I've been working on my profesionnal portfolio these days, and I'm thinking about releasing the theme. It's a very clean and white design, with a jQuery carousel to present my past work. You can see a demo on <a href="http://jfoucher.fr">Jonathan Foucher's portfolio</a>. So, should I release it? Do you like it?
