<a href="http://randypeterman.com/StatTraq">StatTraq</a> seems to be getting more popular. Another <a href="http://boakes.org/index.php?p=94">Wordpress plugin</a> using it has been published by <a href="http://boakes.org">Rich Boakes</a>. It gives the number of times that a particular post has been viewed, and is quite attractive. I think I'll be installing it. Also don't forget to take a look at <a href="http://randypeterman.com/StatTraq/index.php?p=14">the latest version of StatTraq</a>. A great many improvements.
