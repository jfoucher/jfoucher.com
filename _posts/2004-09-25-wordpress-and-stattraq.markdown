[StatTraq](http://randypeterman.com/StatTraq) seems to be getting more popular. Another [Wordpress plugin](http://boakes.org/index.php?p=94) using it has been published by [Rich Boakes](http://boakes.org). It gives the number of times that a particular post has been viewed, and is quite attractive. I think I'll be installing it. Also don't forget to take a look at [the latest version of StatTraq](http://randypeterman.com/StatTraq/index.php?p=14). A great many improvements.
