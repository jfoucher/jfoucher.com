<!--:en-->This plugin allows you to show some text in 'hacker language', as shown below. The install instructions are repeated below in clear text if you have trouble reading this...

To install this plugin, download the <a href="http://jfoucher.com/source/hacker.gz>gzip archive</a>, unpack the hacker.php file within and upload it to your wp-content/plugins directory.

Once you have done this, activate it from the admin interface.

Any text between <hacker> and </hacker> tags will now show in what I call 'hacker style', or 'hacker language', but there must be a better name for this, so please let me know what it is...

That's it ! Pretty useless, but enjoy it anyway...

One big limitation of this version is that you can only have one <hacker></hacker> block in each post due to regex problems. If you can fix that, please do ;)

Edit: The example doesn't work anymore because I'm not using Wordpress at this time. However, you can still download it (I hope ;).<!--:-->
