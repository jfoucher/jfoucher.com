To keep learning and progressing in my line of work, you have to be <strong>learning new things</strong> everyday. The evolution is so fast that if you don't go forward, you are effectively going backwards.
<blockquote>I need ideas of useful apps or libraries to include in this challenge.</blockquote>
So, my<strong> challenge for 2010</strong> will be to build one web app <strong>every month</strong>, and publish it here on the last day of each month. My schedule is pretty tight right now, so the apps will have to be rather quick to develop, but hopefuly it will help me learn new techniques and better coding practices. As they say, "practice makes perfect"...

Whether I use a framework or not is entirely up to me, but I'd like to take this opportunity to try my hand at <a href="http://www.kohanaphp.com/">Kohana</a>. I've been using <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> for nearly one year, and it seems like Kohana takes the CI spirit one step further.

So, this is where I need your help : I need <strong>ideas of useful apps</strong> or libraries to include in this challenge. The first one is going to be a <strong>url shortener</strong>, developping the shortening and storing algorithms from scratch. I'm not sure whether I should do it as a standalone app, a standalone library, or a Kohana library...

So, if you have any ideas about what I should develop, something you need, whatever, please comment below, thanks!

EDIT: The result of the January Challenge is now live : <a href="http://6px.eu/smallurl">The URL shortener</a>
