I just wrote a simple plugin to auto tag new posts. It sends the content to tagthe.net and yahoo and gets back related tags. I must say these
work quite well and can be left on auto pilot if you're like me and not a big fan of tagging your posts...

I use it on <a href="http://renewableenergies.fr">Renewable Energies from the Web</a>, and it seems to be doing quite well.
