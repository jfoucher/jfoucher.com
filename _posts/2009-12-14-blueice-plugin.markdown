<!--:en-->I just created a very simple plugin for <a title="The Anti-CMS" href="http://blueiceapp.com">BlueIce</a>, the anti-CMS. It simply inserts a list containg links to all pages in the web site. The author published it on his <a href="http://blueiceapp.com/docs/plugins">3rd party plugins</a> page, and I highly recommend his anti-CMS for small, semi static sites.

It includes a clever cache system, so your web site will be almost as fast as if it was pure static html. All pages are rendered using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, making for simple content editing, using a <a href="http://geany.org/">text editor</a> and an FTP client.<!--:-->
