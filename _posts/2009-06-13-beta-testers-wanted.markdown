The Feedly-like theme for Wordpress has reached the beta stages. I would like to do a limited round of testing before releasing this theme. Feedly changes so quickly that I'm having trouble keeping up! Only today, I noticed they added the date in a little box on the left hand side, I must admit it's quite useful to see at a glance when the posts were published. I implemented it straight away on WP-feedly, of course!

Below is a video showing how window size changes are handled, using adaptive CSS with Javascript. I  think this is quite useful for users with smaller screen, or for people who do not use their browser full screen. For mobile users, however, this <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/06/12/should-you-use-a-mobile-wordpress-plugin/#comment-1268792">might not be the best solution</a>.
