<a style="float: right; width: 150px;" href="http://jfoucher.com/img/amazonwidget.png&gt;&lt;img src="></a>Hello all,
After quite a few years out of the wordpress world, I'm back using this great CMS, and of course, I had to rewrite one of my old plugins to work with the widget interface.

Well, the Amazon wishlist plugin was the one I like best, and found really useful, although no-one ever bought me a book ;( (hint hint !)

It does not work through the normal API, but just pulls the wishlist page with curl and parses it. I did that because the amazon API does not allow priority sorting, which I find more than useful. You will need curl for that, though...

The widget is configurable, as you can see from the image on the right.
You can see it in action on this site about <a href="http://energies-vertes.org">renewable energy</a>
