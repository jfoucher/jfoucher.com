<!--:en-->You've probably seen that cafepress let's you<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/designer/sigg/"> customize your sigg bottle</a>, and you also no doubt know that water bottles are bad for the <a href="http://ecoquotidien.fr">environment</a>, as only a small proportion are recycled, and many end up scattered around natural areas, not least of which, due to their rather <em>floating</em> nature, our beaches. Sigg bottles are a durable, light and trendy alternative, and today we are going to <em>design our own</em>, but not using <a href="http://cafepress.com">cafepress'</a> flash designer!
<blockquote>There is a better and cheaper way to get your custom sigg bottle.</blockquote>
No, because there is a <em>better and cheaper</em> way to get your custom sigg bottle. Don't want to pay $28 for a bottle ? Don't worry, this solution will get you a three dollars discount per bottle, which added to our 5 dollars <em>cafepress coupon</em> below, will get you a brand new, custom SIGG bottle for around 23 dollars! Of course, you'll have to buy three, because the coupon is only valid for purchases above $50, but these bottles are such great, eco-friendly gifts, that three of them is not nearly enough!

Anyway, to get a cheaper custom sigg bottle, we need to <em>open a cafepress account</em>, and set up a shop. Don't worry, it's completely free. First, click on "sign in" at the top of the home page in cafepress, then click continue once you reach the screen below.

[caption id="attachment_153" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Fill in More Info"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-153" title="More Info" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress3-300x124.jpg" alt="Fill in More Info" width="300" height="124" /></a>[/caption]

You are now given a choice to open a basic or a premium shop.  For our purposes, a free basic shop is sufficient, so click on "Open a basic shop"

[caption id="attachment_155" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Choose shop type"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-155" title="Shop type" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress4-300x217.jpg" alt="Choose shop type" width="300" height="217" /></a>[/caption]

Fill in some more details on the next page and click on "Submit", then click on "Build your shop once you reach the page below

[caption id="attachment_156" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Build your shop"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-156" title="Build your shop" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress5-300x179.jpg" alt="Build your shop" width="300" height="179" /></a>[/caption]

I leave it as an exercise to the reader to insert a product, preferably a Sigg botlle into the shop. Once you reach the screen below, you can keep going.

<blockquote>Draw your image using Gimp or Inkscape, or whatever software you are used to.</blockquote>
Great, you've added a Sigg bottle to your shop. The only slight problem is that it's completely white. We really need to do something about that! So, <em>is your image ready</em>? No? Well let's go then. Cafepress provides a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/content/help/img/templates/280_H_F.jpg">template</a> for the image on the Sigg bottles, and I suggest you follow it to get an image of the proper size. The only thing is that it's at 200 dpi, which seems a bit low for printing, so I suggest you scale it up to at least 300 DPI, or a pixel size of 975x1800. Here is <a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/280_H_R.png">my template at 600 DPI</a>

Draw your image using <a href="http://gimp.org">Gimp</a> or <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, or whatever software you are used to, or just choose a photograph from your collection. The thing to keep in mind is that the shape of the template is the maximum size of your image, but it can be smaller...

Ok, so now you have your image the way you like it, I suggest you <em>give it a try</em> on the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/designer/sigg/">flash designer</a>. When you are entirely satisfied, click on "edit" below the image of the bottle to get to the page shown on the screenshot below.

[caption id="attachment_161" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Add image"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-161" title="Add image" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress7-300x207.jpg" alt="Add image" width="300" height="207" /></a>[/caption]

On the right hand side, click on the "select image" button, then on "Upload image", which brings you to a page where you can upload a number of images, choose and <em>upload your image</em>. It takes a few steps, which I'm not going to detail here.

[caption id="attachment_165" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Image applied to bottle"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress8.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" title="Image applied to bottle" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress8-300x205.jpg" alt="Image applied to bottle" width="300" height="205" /></a>[/caption]

Once you selected the image to apply to your bottle, you can tweak it's size, but if you used the template, it should fill all the space available, see screenshot above.

Click next, and you can write a title, a description and choose a price for your item. Don't worry, you'll be able to buy it at the base price later, so <em>set any markup you like</em>. I didn't touch anything, as it doesn't matter for our purposes. But feel free to change things if you want to sell your custom bottle later.

[caption id="attachment_166" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Change item details"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress9.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166" title="Change item details" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress9-300x195.jpg" alt="Change item details" width="300" height="195" /></a>[/caption]

Once you click "save and finish", <em>your custom Sigg bottle is created!</em> You can now buy it at the base price by following these instructions : first, click on the "your shops" link at the top left of the page shown above, then on "buy" on the same line as your shop's name, and then "Click to buy from your own shop", after which you get to the product page for your custom bottle, which you can then buy following normal procedures.

[caption id="attachment_167" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Buy your custom Sigg bottle"]<a href="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-167" title="Buy your custom Sigg bottle" src="http://jfoucher.comcdn.jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/07/cafepress11-300x129.jpg" alt="Buy your custom Sigg bottle" width="300" height="129" /></a>[/caption]

When you get to the checkout form, fill in the following Cafepress coupon code: POPPYSNEEZE to get a further $5 discount, on purchases over $50.


<blockquote>
Cafepress coupon code: a further $5 discount</blockquote>



And that's it, your three brand new, custom, home made sigg bottles for <strong>$76.22</strong> including shipping.

A further tip if you want a different design on each bottle : as the free version of cafepress doesn't allow you to sell more than one product of each type in each shop, open several free shops with a different Sigg bottle in each!

I hope you enjoy this post. If you decide to follow this tutorial, send a pic of your bottle in the comments.<!--:-->
