Ok, my blog is back online after about a year in the meanders of my hard drive. Most of the stuff here is probably out of date, such as the Worpdress plugins, most of them written for pre-1.5 versions. As I don't use WP anymore, I'm unlikely to come up with more stuff, unless I decide to come back to it at some stage.

I think I will now write about other things, what exacly I'm not sure yet...
