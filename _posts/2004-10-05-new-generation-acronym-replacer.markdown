[This post](http://www.100px.com/100wordpress/remplazador_de_acronimos_la_nueva_generacion/) describes a new kind of acronym replacer, where you don't need to touch a line of PHP to define new acronyms, and can make them link directly to some place. For example, AOL could become <a href="http://aol.com">AOL</a>.

You can get the plugin <a href="http://www.100px.com/wordpress/d/acronym-revisited.zip">here</a> directly.

I haven't tried it myself, so I can't give you an opinion, but it does sound good, doesn't it?
