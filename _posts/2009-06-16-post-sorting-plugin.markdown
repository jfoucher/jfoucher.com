UPDATE : A post sort plugin already exists, take a look at <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smart-sort/">this one.</a>

You've probably noticed that there is no option to sort posts any other way than by date in Wordpress. I've had several requests to be able to sort post from the oldest to the newest, which Wordpress cannot do with a simple one button option.

I think I can hear the critics already ;) : "What, but that is sacrilegious! It's not a blog anymore then!" but maybe these users do not want a blog per se, but only an easy to maintain, good looking and accessible website, for whatever purpose. If you had written a novel and wanted to publish it in installments, it would only be logical to start with the first chapter, right? And if you wanted a glossary, the only viable option is to have it sorted alphabetically.

So, what about a plugin that allows you to sort in date order, reverse date order, and alphabetically? Should it have the ability to sort posts on other criteria? Does something like this already exists?

I'll await some feedback before starting work on this, so don't hesitate to post a comment.<!--:-->
