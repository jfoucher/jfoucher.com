<h3>1. You need to have it open in your browser to appear online</h3>
<h3>2. Nobody is ever online for that exact reason.</h3>
<h3>3. All my contacts disappeared</h3>
For no apparent reason, none of my contacts are showing in wave right now... Kind of reduces the usability.
<h3>4. Too many ads in independently developped "gadgets"</h3>
<h3>5. Counter intuitive interface.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"pinging" someone just opens a new wave with that contact : I could have done that myself... Do something more, like, I don't know, send an email</li>
	<li>can't search trough a list to add contacts that are on wave</li>
</ul>

<h3>And now (oh the irony) to the Wave invite giveaway.</h3>

Very easy : leave a comment on this post with your real email address, and on Monday at 12 GMT I'll pick ten winners. (yes I have that many unused invites...)

Have a good weekend
