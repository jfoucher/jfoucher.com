!["Google Wave"](http://jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/11/Screenshot-1.png)

* You need to have it open in your browser to appear online
* Nobody is ever online for that exact reason
* All my contacts disappeared: For no apparent reason, none of my contacts are showing in wave right now... Kind of reduces the usability.
* Too many ads in independently developped "gadgets"
* Counter intuitive interface.
* "pinging" someone just opens a new wave with that contact : I could have done that myself... Do something more, like, I don't know, send an email
* can't search trough a list to add contacts that are on wave

### And now (oh the irony) to the Wave invite giveaway.

Very easy : leave a comment on this post with your real email address, and on Monday at 12 GMT I'll pick ten winners. (yes I have that many unused invites...)

Have a good weekend
