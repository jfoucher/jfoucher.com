You've probably already tried <a href="http://faceyourmanga.com">this web site</a>, that allows you to create a caricature of yourself, manga style. It's pretty well done, and I don't think there's another equivalent. The only problem is that you only get a small, low quality image by email when you're done editing your avatar. This image is 178x178 pixels, which is fine to use as an avatar on most sites, and even to display on the web.

But I have to admit I'm a high res addict, and just had to find a way to get a better resolution picture.

<img src="http://jfoucher.com/uploads/2009/06/mangatar2big-150x150.png" alt="Mangatar" title="Mangatar" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-77" />

The solution is easy if you're using Firefox as your browser. I made use of the zoom feature to zoom in on the flash where the avatar creation occurs, and as flash does not lose resoution as you zoom in on it, you just have to print your screen when you are at the size you want and voil√†! your high(er) res mangatar!

Click on the image on the right to view the full resolution version of my avatar. Once you get your own high-res avatar, it is much easier to vectorize it properly, using for example <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> or <a href="http://vectormagic.com">Vector Magic</a>.

You can also <a href="http://jfoucher.com/img/mangatar.svgz">download my own avatar in svgz format</a>
