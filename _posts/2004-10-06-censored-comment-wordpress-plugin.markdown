<!--:en-->Another wordpress plugin. This one shows a user definable text on comments that have been edited or censored. I got the idea from <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/about/">Michael Heilemann</a> <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/10/05/binary-bonsai-support-forum/">complaining</a> about some useless comments on his site.

Well, there you go, Michael!

Download <a href="http://jfoucher.com/source/censored/>the source</a> or the same in<a href="http://jfoucher.com/source/censored.gz> gzip format</a> and put it in a php file in your wp-content/plugins directory. Activate it from the admin interface. That's it, good to go!

You can change the text that is displayed when a comment has been edited in the plugin source itself, you could even use a small image or whatever...<!--:-->
