<!--:en-->I  really like <a title="Feed Reader Firefox extension" href="http://feedly.com">feedly</a>, which I use to read my feeds in Firefox. The appearance and the functionnality are great. It's a pity it's only available for Firefox, as I tend to use Chromium more often now.

Anyway, I decided I could make a <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> theme that would mimic the looks and functionality of Feedly.  I think I'm getting there, I'd say I'm at about 70% of what I want to achieve. Of course, not <em>all</em> the features of feedly will be available, as some, such as the ability to mark an item read, to not make sense for a blog. Others will come little by little in future release, as I don't think they are<strong> </strong><em>that</em> important to usability, such as the popup boxes when posting to <a href="http://twitter.com/jfoucher">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us/jfoucher">delicious</a>, for example.

Anyway, here's a screenshot of what I have at the moment, so please tell me what you think !

EDIT: It's ready ! <a href="http://jfoucher.com/general/wpfeedly-theme-download/">Download it now</a>
