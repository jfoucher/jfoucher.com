Founder of [Six Pixels](http://6px.eu), a web design and development shop operating out of France

I have a degree in Yacht Design from [Southampton Solent University](https://www.solent.ac.uk/). I am first and foremost a [freelance web developper, based in France](http://jfoucher.com) and working for international companies and public entities.

Some of my clients include global companies like Bosch and Coca Cola, and spanish ones such as Fundaci√≥n Mapfre, Ayuntamiento de Alcobendas and Museo Thyssen.

I love working with PHP and Javascript to develop an engaging user experience. I also really enjoy learning new skills. For example, at the moment, I am simultaneously writing an iOs app, releasing my first Reactjs project [Budgt](https://budgt.eu) and more !
