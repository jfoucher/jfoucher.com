                <p>Sorry, the page you asked for isn&rsquo;t at this location; it could have been misplaced.</p>
                <p class="note">If you came here from a page on this site, it's almost certainly my fault. I you came
                    from somewhere else, it's also probably my fault.</p>
                <p>The only thing you can do now is search for what you&rsquo;re looking for. Also it would be great if
                    you could <a href="/about.html#notebook" title="Contact me">tell me where you came from to arrive here</a>. I promise I'll fix it straight away!</p>
