<p>Founder of <a href="http://6px.eu">Six Pixels</a>, a web design and development shop operating out of spain</p>

<p>I have a degree in Yacht Design from Southampton Solent University. I am first and foremost a <a href="http://jfoucher.fr">freelance web developper, based in France</a> and working for international companies and public entities.</p>

<p>Some of my clients include global companies like Bosch and Coca Cola, and spanish ones such as Fundaci√≥n Mapfre, Ayuntamiento de Alcobendas and Museo Thyssen.</p>

<p>I love working with PHP and Javascript to develop an engaging user experience. I also really enjoy learning new skills. For example, at the moment, I am simultaneously writing an iOs app, an Android app, a Java enterprise web application, moving my blog from <a href="http://jfoucher.com/wordpress/" title="My Wordpress plugins and themes">Wordpress</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/">Jekyll</a>, developping desktop apps with <a href="http://appcelerator.com">appcelerator Titanium</a> and working on a few PHP webapps.</p>
